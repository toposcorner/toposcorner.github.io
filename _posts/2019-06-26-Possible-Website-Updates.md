There are many features that I would like to implement in the website. I've listed from most to less urgent, also 

- Author tags or link to Author Page
- Author page
- Sort posts by popularity or other categorization
- [Markdeep](http://casual-effects.com/markdeep/features.md.html)
- [three.js](https://threejs.org/)
- Search Functionality
- Login functionality ?
- Interface to write a post...


Please tell me if there is something urgent to implement or if you want something to put in the queue.
