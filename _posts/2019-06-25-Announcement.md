The site is now open !

First of all we want to greet all of our contributors and start by telling what is the idea behind this site.

##Vision

This site was born as an answer to the problem of «focusing» on today's immediacy world. These contemporary world is so full of novel and interesting ideas, but they are difficult to distinguish from all the noise. As a consequence nowadays is difficult to materialize sophisticated thoughts and ideas that lie in our head because of the rate of arrival of new ideas. Henceforth our deep notions and the thoughts that make us ponder never materialize into any of the conventional ways of sharing intellectual ideas(manuscripts, videos). These traditional ways require an extensive amount of time to pull out, and we DON'T want that. Thereby in this site we hope to store half-baked thoughts and incomplete ideas, since they can be written much quicker and we don't want them to be lost into oblivion.

With this spirit in mind we don't require that the post entries are at all sophisticated, the idea is to formalize your thoughts in a written form. Nevertheless it would be great if you write something complex, since it would contribute to the site's quality. But also it's just fine to simply post a video and a couple of comments as if you were introducing it to a friend. Another option is to maintain a diary of your research and post your intermediate thoughts. In the same way we want to maintain the liberty of sharing anything with no worry of being intellectually judged, since it's meant to be a place for « rapid prototyping».

As a consequence we can materialize our thoughts quickly so that we distinguish the thoughts that really matter from the noise. In this way by reflecting while writing and sharing the ideas with other people, we all contribute to a deeper understanding of the concepts.
